## üõ†Ô∏è Description
<!--Remove the below lines and add yours -->
Predict future stock prices using LSTM neural networks. This beginner-friendly project analyzes past stock data to forecast future trends, helping users make informed investment decisions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Languages or Frameworks Used
<!--Remove the below lines and add yours -->
Python: The primary programming language for writing the script and implementing the LSTM model.

Pandas: A Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It's commonly used for handling the historical stock price data.

NumPy: A fundamental package for numerical computing in Python. It's used for array manipulation and mathematical operations, often in conjunction with Pandas.

Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating visualizations in Python. It's used for plotting the actual and predicted stock prices.

Keras: A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow. It's used for building and training the LSTM model.

scikit-learn (optional): If you're performing additional data preprocessing or evaluation tasks beyond what Keras provides, you might use scikit-learn, a machine learning library in Python.

## üåü How to run
